<p>My dissertation is finally finished.
Before finishing my dissertation, I was eager to share it with my classmates so that they could read and give me suggestions.
Normally, I would give them read-only access on the Git or Subversion repository containing my dissertation, so that they can check out the LaTeX source files, and then compile the dissertation.
This procedure creates a hurdle for them, because LaTeX is normally not installed on mobile devices they might use.</p><p>For most people, the solution would be sending PDF attachments.
However, when I add more and more text and pictures into my dissertation, the PDF becomes increaseingly large, and I don&#39;t want to send large files and use up the quota of my and my classmates&#39; mailboxes.
There is a better solution.</p><p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Netlify</a> is a free hosting service for static web sites.
It provides a Node.js client app, which can deploy a prepared website from the command line.
It can also pick up commits into a git repository, and compile the website from source code.</p><p>While my dissertation is not a website, hosting it on Netlify is totally feasible.
Although Netlify&#39;s <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/" target="_blank" rel="external">continuous deployment</a> does not support LaTeX, I can still compile the PDF locally, and upload it to Netlify.
To do so, I added a <strong>Makefile</strong> rule:</p>

<p>Most of my social life during my <a href="/t/2017/six-years-in-arizona/">six years at University of Arizona</a> was at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mtwua/" target="_blank" rel="external">International Student Association (ISA)</a>.
I made friends, made frenemies, and had fun through events and gatherings organized by ISA.</p><p><img src="/t/2017/ISA/TrailDustTown.jpg" alt="ISA Trail Dust Town visit, Apr 04, 2013" class="pure-img"></p><h2 id="The-Very-First-Event"><a href="#The-Very-First-Event" class="headerlink" title="The Very First Event"></a>The Very First Event</h2><p>Every incoming international student is required to attend the International Student Orientation, organized by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110719140111/http://internationalstudents.arizona.edu/home" target="_blank" rel="external">International Student Programs and Services (ISPS)</a>.
In the 2011 orientation, ISPS recruited a group of student workers, called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110717020644/http://internationalstudents.arizona.edu:80/peerintegrator" target="_blank" rel="external">Peer Integrators (PIs)</a>, to assist with the orientation, and to plan and participate in orientation social events for new international students.
One of the social events was a <strong>campus race</strong> on Aug 14, 2011, organized by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/morris.zhou" target="_blank" rel="external">Morris Zhou</a>, a PI from China.
I participated in this event because its name sounds like my favorite TV show <a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/amazing_race/" target="_blank" rel="external">The Amazing Race</a>.</p><p>The goal of this event was to make students familiarize with the UA campus.
Each team of two or three students were given a sheet of hints, each referring to a location on campus.
Within one hour, the team must visit as many locations as they can, and take pictures of the team members in front of those locations.
The team that gets the largest number of correct answers would be awarded the winner.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.geocaching.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Geocaching</a> is an outdoor treasure hunt game.
Participants, or &quot;geocachers&quot;, use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to hide and seek containers, called &quot;geocaches&quot; or &quot;caches&quot;, at specific locations marked by coordinates all over the world.
I learned about geocaching by accident in Jul 2013, and I was immediately hooked to this game.
Since then, Geocaching had a strong influence in my weekend activities, gadget purchases, and travel choices.</p><p><img src="/t/2017/start-geocaching/GC5WHZV.jpg" alt="selfie with GC5WHZV container" class="pure-img"></p><h2 id="It-All-Started-from-Jenny"><a href="#It-All-Started-from-Jenny" class="headerlink" title="It All Started from Jenny"></a>It All Started from Jenny</h2><p>Grocery stores offer discounts with a loyalty card, but I forgot to bring mine on Jul 12, 2013.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/daniel.harms" target="_blank" rel="external">Daniel</a>&#39;s answer mentioned that I could enter &quot;area code + 867-5309&quot; as the phone number, and there is usually a loyalty card associated with this phone number.

<p>When I was little, taxis were my favorite form of transportation.
I could have my own seat in the taxi, and the taxi would go directly to the destination.
I would not need to walk to the bus stop, wait for the bus, get squeezed in the bus, and walk to the destination after getting off the bus.
In early 1990s, taxi fare of a 5KM trip was about 30 times the bus fare.
However, I didn&#39;t understand the value of money at that time, so I always wanted to travel by taxi.</p><p>I started attending a boarding school since the seventh grade.
Mom would give me ¡Í65 every week, and I was allowed to spend the money however I wish, but this money was all I have for meals, transportation, and anything else except books and school supplies.
While I could spend ¡Í5 to take a taxi from the bus terminal to the school, I usually chose to walk 20 minutes and save the money for snacks.
I got used to bus rides and long walks, and forgot about taxis, when money became a constraint.
In fact, I got so used to public transportation that, even if I was on a business trip when I later worked for a company, I would prefer to take a bus instead of a taxi, and I sometimes had to explain to finance why I could not produce a receipt for a bus ride.</p><p>When I came to Tucson in 2011, having limited cash and being accustomed to public transportation, my primary form of transportation is of course <a href="/t/2017/SunTran/">the city bus</a>.
However, the operating hours of city buses are limited.
When I <a href="/t/2017/first-days-in-Tucson/">stayed in Grant Inn during my first days</a>, the last route 20 bus from UA campus back to Grant Inn was departing at 18:20.
If I wanted to stay at school later than that, I would have to find my alternate transportation.</p><h2 id="Clint-39-s-Taxi"><a href="#Clint-39-s-Taxi" class="headerlink" title="Clint&#39;s Taxi"></a>Clint&#39;s Taxi</h2><p>When I was dropped off at Grant Inn, the volunteer gave each student a business card of &quot;Clint&#39;s Taxi&quot;, and told us to call Clint when we need to go to school.
Since buses are cheaper, I took the city bus most of the time.
On Aug 14, 2011, I attended a &quot;Campus Race&quot; scavenger hunt activity, organized by an organization called Meet The World, which later became <a href="/t/2017/ISA/">International Student Association (ISA)</a>.
The activity lasted until 20:00, at which point there were no more buses available.
This was when I called Clint for the first time.</p>

<p><a href="/t/2017/SunTran/">Sun Tran</a> bus system was my primary form of transportation during my <a href="/t/2017/six-years-in-arizona/">six years at University of Arizona</a>, but it wasn&#39;t my only transportation.
Sun Tran services city of Tucson, city of South Tucson, and select areas out of city limits.
When I needed to go beyond the service boundary, or to haul cargo, it makes sense to get my own set of wheels.</p><p>I decided not to buy a car during graduate school early on.
When I attended my first &quot;grad tea&quot;, a social event among computer science grad students, I asked an American student the cost of owning a car, and the answer was $200 per month including &quot;everything&quot;.
A simple calculation indicated that owning a car would not be a good financial decision for me.
Owning a car would allow me to rent an apartment far from the campus, but it is unlikely to find an apartment that is cheaper than $439/mo NorthPointe.</p><p><img src="/t/2017/behind-the-wheels/brenton.jpg" alt="Zipcar Nissan Altima Brenton" class="pure-img"></p><h2 id="Arizona-Driver-39-s-License"><a href="#Arizona-Driver-39-s-License" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Driver&#39;s License"></a>Arizona Driver&#39;s License</h2><p>Fast forward to spring 2014, when my life at NorthPointe <a href="/t/2017/roommates-or-not/">went downhill</a> due to a noisy roommate.
I signed a lease at my new apartment, and <strong>moving</strong> was put on the agenda.
I <a href="/t/2017/first-days-in-Tucson/">moved from Grant Inn</a> to NorthPointe on a taxi, at which time all I had was two checked bags and two carry-on bags.
Three years later, I had accumulated many more things than that, and the <a href="/t/2017/hailing-taxis/">taxi driver</a> would be charging by minute while I&#39;m loading my stuff into his trunk.
Thus, I need a driver&#39;s license!</p>

<p>Tucson is a &quot;small&quot; town.
Compared to my hometown Shanghai, Tucson is 10 times smaller in land area, and has 3% of Shanghai&#39;s metro population.
Nevertheless, Tucson is still the second largest city in Arizona.
You can&#39;t reasonably walk to everything, so transportation is a necessity.</p><p>America is a country on wheels, but Tucson has a nice public transportation system, <a href="http://www.suntran.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Sun Tran</a>.
During my <a href="/t/2017/six-years-in-arizona/">six years at University of Arizona</a>, I never bought a car, but used Sun Tran bus system extensively.</p><p><img src="/t/2017/SunTran/bus3000.jpg" alt="Sun Tran bus 3000" class="pure-img"></p><h2 id="City-Bus-in-Shanghai-vs-Tucson"><a href="#City-Bus-in-Shanghai-vs-Tucson" class="headerlink" title="City Bus in Shanghai vs Tucson"></a>City Bus in Shanghai vs Tucson</h2><p>American city bus system do not have a good reputation: vehicles are old, schedules are infrequent, and operating hours are limited.

<p>Food, water, shelter, and warmth are the basic needs of human beings.
Food is available in any restaurant and grocery store.
Tap water is safe to drink, as I asked <a href="/t/2017/first-days-in-Tucson/">at the orientation</a>.
Warmth is not an urgent problem when I arrive because I have enough clothes in my luggage.
The biggest problem is: housing!</p><p>There are two main housing options for University of Arizona students: on campus housing and off campus housing.
If I live on campus, I can walk to class and enjoy all the good vibes, but the room is small and costs a ton of money.
Thus, during my <a href="/t/2017/six-years-in-arizona">six years in Arizona</a>, I lived exclusively in off-campus housing.
This article describes the two apartments I lived in, shares my experiences of living with or without roommates, and includes reviews of NorthPointe Student Apartments and University Arms Apartments from a real tenant.</p><h2 id="How-I-Evaluate-Off-Campus-Housing"><a href="#How-I-Evaluate-Off-Campus-Housing" class="headerlink" title="How I Evaluate Off-Campus Housing"></a>How I Evaluate Off-Campus Housing</h2><p>When I started surveying off-campus housing options, I set a few requirements:</p><ul>
<li>I must have my own bedroom.
When I was an undergraduate in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I shared an on-campus dormitory with three other boys.
We lived in the same bedroom, went to class together, and were good friends.
The dorm manager enforced strict rules such as &quot;lights off&quot; time.
However, American off-campus housing has no such strict rules, so sharing a bedroom is going to cause roommate conflicts in the long term, and I&#39;m not really into <a href="/t/2006/trends-of-chinese-family/">cohabiting</a>.</li>
<li>I want to have my own bathroom.
I saw too many TV episodes about how American kids make a mess in the bathroom, or spend too long time in the shower in the morning when I would need to go to class.</li>
<li>I prefer to have individual leases.
Some property owners would rent out a big house to multiple students on one lease.
If any tenant quits, the remaining tenants still must pay the full rent.
I would not want to get into such trouble.</li>
<li>I can get to school without a car.
Owning a car is too much hassle for me.</li>

<p>Six years ago, on Apr 12, 2011, I was admitted as a PhD student in the Computer Science PhD program at The University of Arizona.
After a round of paperwork and an interview for the US visa, I flew from Shanghai, China to Tucson, Arizona on Aug 04, 2011.
This was when it all began.</p><h2 id="The-Flight-and-Arrival"><a href="#The-Flight-and-Arrival" class="headerlink" title="The Flight and Arrival"></a>The Flight and Arrival</h2><p>My uncle bought me an one-way flight ticket.
I was booked on United flight 588 departing PVG at 20:10, transfering to United flight 6458 arriving TUS at 21:10.
The time difference between Shanghai and Tucson is 15 hours, so this seemingly 1-hour flight route is actually 16 hours.</p><p>My dad drove me to the airport, with mom and grandpa also in the car.
After saying goodbye to my family, an officer stamped my passport indicating that I had left China territory.
I had two checked bags full of clothing and cookware, a duffle bag with more clothes, and a briefcase containing an old laptop.
I also had thirteen $100 bills, a few $20 and $10 bills, and several quarter-dollar coins; this was all the cash I had.</p><p><img src="/t/2017/first-days-in-Tucson/goodbye-family.jpg" alt="say goodbye to grandpa" class="pure-img"></p>
